# Open Space

Open Space Workspace is an innovative, open-source platform designed to revolutionize the software development process. Our goal is to create a community-driven alternative to GitHub Copilot Workspace, offering similar features and capabilities while maintaining the principles of open-source software.

Key Features:

Task Initialization: Seamlessly integrate with popular version control platforms to start projects from repositories or issues.
- AI-Powered Planning: Utilize open-source language models to generate step-by-step development plans based on project context and requirements.
- Editable Workflows: Provide fully customizable plans and code suggestions, allowing developers to maintain creative control.
- Integrated Development Environment: Offer a built-in code editor and execution environment for testing and iterating on generated code.
- Collaboration Tools: Enable easy sharing of workspaces and real-time collaboration among team members.
- Version Control Integration: Seamlessly create pull requests and integrate with popular CI/CD tools.

By creating Open Space Workspace, we aim to democratize AI-assisted software development, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels while fostering innovation and collaboration within the open-source community. This project will not only provide a powerful tool for developers but also serve as a platform for researching and improving AI-assisted coding techniques in an open, transparent manner.
